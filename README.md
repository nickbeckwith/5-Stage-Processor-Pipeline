# 5 Stage Processor Pipeline

This was a final project for UW's ECE 552 Computer Architecture Class.

We were tasked with three different iterations of this processor.
The first stage was implementing a single stage processor.
The second stage was implementing a 5 stage processor pipeline
The final stage was implementing seperarate data and instruction caches with a memory model that had a 4 cycle memory delay.

During the course of the project, the instructor restricted our use of verilog to mostly RTL design minus large scale operations such as addition and shifting by a variable amount. This gave us a better sense of the actual hardware creating the pipelined processor.

Future goals for this repository is creating a branch predictor and 4 way associative caches.
